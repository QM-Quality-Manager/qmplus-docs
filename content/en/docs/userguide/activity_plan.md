This section deals with managing the `Activity plan`.

Clicking on the `Activity plan` gives access to the activity plan allowing the a user to schedule new activities like filling out a form, questionnaire or marking a document as read.

## Overview
{{< figure src="/images/activity_plan/activity_plan_1.png" caption="Activity plan overview" width="1024">}}
 
The `Activity plan` overview mode shows us a `Scheduler view` of all the calendars and their activites as well as a more traditional `Calendar` view. The user can adjust the period of the `Scheduler view` by clicking the arrow buttons and the `Period view` of the `Scheduler` by clicking the `Month`, `Week` or `Day` buttons.
