This section deals with managing departments in the system.

Clicking on the `Administrator/Department` gives access to the list of departments.

## Departments List

{{< figure src="/images/departments/department_1.png" caption="Department list overview" width="1024">}}

The list of child departments for the currently selected department. In this view we can filter departments by if they are `Active`, `Inactive` or `All`.

You can create a new department that will become a child department of the currently selected department.

> Furthermore one can add `permissions/roles` to the department limiting the access to the department to users with either user types containing the permissions/roles or roles added directly on the user.
