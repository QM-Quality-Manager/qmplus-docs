This section deals with using and managing the `Marketplace`.

Clicking on the `Marketplace` provides access to the marketplace, allowing us to use existing packages or create our own packages to publish.

> The marketplace is an open space shared by all customers of `Q`. `Q` publishes free general packages available to all our customers.

## Find and Purchase

The `Marketplace` enables you to search for new packages containing documents, forms, and questionnaires to import, allowing you to get started quickly. Clicking on the package displays the contents of the package.

{{< zoomableImage src="/images/marketplace/marketplace_12.png" caption="Buildup of package" width="1600" height="600px">}}

There are three tabs for a package.

| Tab | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `Groups` | Groups organize forms, documents, and questionnaires into units. |
| `Description` | The description of the package. |
| `Terms of use` | Any terms of usage or copyright for the package content that you agree to when purchasing the package. |

To purchase the package, click on the `Purchase` button. For now, all the packages are free, but this might change in the future.

You can click on a group to see the listing of content.
