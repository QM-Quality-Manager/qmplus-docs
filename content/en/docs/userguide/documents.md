The `Documents` menu grants users access to all document dashboards that are visible to them based on their assigned department and permissions.

Users can navigate between different lists by clicking on the arrow next to the current dashboard name. They can also click on individual documents to open them and mark documents as favorites for easier access later.

> Documents marked as favorites will be visible in the user's dashboard if they have added the `Favorite Documents` component to their dashboard. This feature makes it more convenient to quickly access frequently used or important documents.
