## Messages

The messages view provides a comprehensive and convenient way to manage message cases by enabling you to quickly locate specific message cases or a group of related message cases. You can search by title and description, apply specific filters, and customize the visible columns. An Excel export function allows you to extract the cases into an Excel sheet effortlessly.

### Filters
