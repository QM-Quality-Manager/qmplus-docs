The notifications option allows the current user to modify their notification settings.

> If the settings are grayed out, it means the administrator for your organization has disabled the option for users to customize their own notification settings and have enforced organizational settings.

The notification settings are ordered by priority, enabling you to enable/disable notifications for any given priority level and set the delivery time for any reminders sent by email to the logged-in user.

Click the `Save Changes` button to apply any changes.
