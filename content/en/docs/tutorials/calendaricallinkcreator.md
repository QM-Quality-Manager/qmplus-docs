#### Select the Activity Calendar
{{< zoomableImage src="/images/calendaricallinkcreator/calendaricallinkcreator_1_en.png" caption="Activity Calendar." width="1600" height="600px">}}

To start the process click the little Calendar icon in the top left. This will open the create subscription link dialog.

#### Create Subscription Link
{{< zoomableImage src="/images/calendaricallinkcreator/calendaricallinkcreator_2_en.png" caption="Create subscription link." width="1600" height="600px">}}

The dialog will allow the generation of a link that you can use to subscribe to the calendar using any compatible calendar application that support the iCalendar format. This includes Microsoft Exchange, Apple Calendar, Google Calendar and many others.

Ensure the calendar name field is filled in with the title you want to appear in your calendar application. If you leave it blank the calendar name will be set to `Activity Calendar`.

There are some options in the calendar subscription link dialog that allows you to configure what is included in the calendar subscription.

On the left side we have settings that control the following options.

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Department` | The department that will be used as the basis for the calendar. |
| `Visibility` | The visibility option that will be used for the calendar when selecting sub departments. The options are `This department` and `This and subordinate departments` |
| `Select artifact types` | The task types that will be included in the calendar subscription. The options are `Forms`, `Questionnaires` and `Read and Confirm` |

> Since all the data in the platform is associated with departments the departments and visibility option lets you set what department data should be included in the subscription.

The right side allows for the selection of what calendars should be included in the subscription. It allows the user to create a calendar that includes or or more calendars into a single subscription to avoid having to subscribe to multiple calendars.

Finally to copy the link to your `clipboard` click the `Copy link` button. This will copy the link to your clipboard and allow you to paste it into your calendar application.

> You can create as many variations of the calendar subscription link as you like. This allows you to create a calendar subscription link for each department or artifact type that you want to subscribe to. You can also create a calendar subscription link for each department and artifact type combination that you want to subscribe to.
