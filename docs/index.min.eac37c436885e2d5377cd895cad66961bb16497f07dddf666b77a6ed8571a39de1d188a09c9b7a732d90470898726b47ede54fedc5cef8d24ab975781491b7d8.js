Overview # Dashboards are collections of components that you can build to monitor the state of the platform. You can build dashboards for specific objectives or to make specific information available. There are two types of dashboards.
Type Description User Dashboards the user themselves can build, with components available for them. User Type Read only dashboards created for a specific user types. Used to share fixed information across all users of a specific user type. Can be used to ensure everyone is reporting on the same information. Configure User Type Dashboards # dashboards_22.png To create or modify User Type dashboards first navigate to the User Types list. Click on one of the User Types to bring up the User Type and then click on the Dashboards tab.

Type Description System System permissions are permissions that control the access to sections or actions in the application itself and provided from the application. These might be permissions that let you administer users for example or view reports. These cannot be customized by the user and as new functionality is added might expand. Custom Custom permissions are permissions that the user can create that can be used to tag content such as documents, or limit access to things like departments. For example you might have a confidential document that you only want two people to access to. In this case you could make a confidential document custom permission and assign it to the document as well as the two users that you want to have access. The lack of the permission will block the user from being able to access the document. See all available System Permissions

Tokens Listing # API Tokens Listing Mobile users logged in Listing There are two main types of tokens in the system.
Token Type Description API Tokens Tokens used to integrate with Q using external applications or code. Mobile users logged in An overview of Mobile Application tokens, allowing us to view who uses the Mobile App and also revoke access. Tokens are tied to a User and User Type. This allows you to control access more fine-grained by using permissions to restrict acces. You might for example make a token that only allows access to Department A and has no access to operate on users.
Deleting Tokens # Deleting multiple mobile user tokens, revoking access Tokens can also be deleted to revoke access both for the API Token and Mobile Users logged in. Either one by one or by using the checkbox on the left side to select multiple entries to delete at the same time.
Inspect a Token # Clickin on a Token will bring up information about the token. This screen is different depending on if it\u0026rsquo;s an API Token or Mobile users logged in Token.
Mobile Users logged in token view When selecting a Mobile User Token you get the following information.
Field Description User name The user name associated with the token. Email The email associated with the token. Department The department the token is associated with. User Type The user type the token is associated with. Last active Last time the user was active. Expiry date The current expiry date for the token. API Token view The API Token view is a litte bit different because our expectation is that you will need access to the actual token.
Field Description Token name The name entered when creating the token. API Token The token string used to call the REST API. Tenant Id Application customer Id. Description of use Basic text that explains how to use the token to call the REST API endpoints. Expiry date The entered expiry date for this API token. Associated user The user used to establish permissions when using the API. Department and User Type The combination controls access to data in the system by Department and User Type. Create a new API Token # We can create new API Token to use for integration. We need to provide the following fields.
Field Description Token name The name entered when creating the token. Expiry date Set the expiry date of the token, we suggest no longer than 12 months for any single token. Select user Select the user who will be used for permissions checking. Select department \u0026amp; user type Select the Department and User Type associated with this token.

Clicking on the Administrator/Workflows gives access to the list of workflows.
Workflows List # The Workflows list overview lets you see all workflows defined in the system. Workflows are global and shared by all departments in the organization.
Workflows can be activated and deactivated as needed. This does not affect existing form types that use the workflow but makes it impossible to create new form types of that particular workflow.
Create Workflow # There are four tabs to consider when creating a new workflow.
Tab Description General Entering general details for workflow. Table Edit the statuses, transitions and dialogs that make up the workflow. Graph A graphical representation of the workflow. Processing Default processing settings for the workflow such as automatic deadlines etc. General Tab # The general page allows us to fill out the following fields.
Field Description Title Specify the title of the workflow, support multiple languages if your account is configured for it. Entity Type Select the entity type of the workflow, once set it cannot be changed. This can be Message, Action, Document, Hearing or Audit Disable transitions checking This lets you override any transitions, making it possible to freely drag tickts between any transitions on the case board. Great when you want to implement Kanban processes or other non-gated processes Start case status Set the default case start status. This is the case status that will be assigned to a new case for this workflow if no other rules override it. Close case status Set the default close case status used for default close operations. Early caseprocess Specify that this workflow supports the use of Early caseprocess rules set up to assign new cases to case handlers based on specified rules. Associated hearing workflow Document only. Allows you to specify an associated hearings workflow to this document workflow that will handle any hearings initiated for a document attached to this workflow. Associated audit workflow Document only. Allows you to specify an associated audit workflow to this document workflow to handle all hearings. Table Tab # The Table Tab allows us to build and modifty the workflow entities. There are three types of available entities.
Entity Description Case Status Case statuses are defined states a case can be in. For example you might have a case status called New for a newly registered form entry and Closed for the final possible state for a case. Transitions Transitions control the flow of case between case statuses. It makes it possible to enforce a workflow by specifying the legal transitions between statuses. For example you might make it possible to only move a case from New to Under work by adding a single transition between those statuses. Dialogs Dialogs are collections of fields that can bet attached to a transition. For example you might decide that you want the user to add a comment when moving a case from the case status New to Under work and a dialog attached to this transition between those fields will lead the dialog to pop up for the user to fill out when moving between the statuses. Create Status # To create a new Case status you need to enter the following fields.
Field Description Name The name of the case status, support multiple languages. Status Group The Status Group for this Case Status, see the table below for explenations. Description Optional description for the case status. The possible Status Groups are detailed below.
Status Group Description Open A case is in a newly opened (first time it was opened state). This is basically used to signal a new case starting. Unprocessed A case has been created but not yet opened by any case handler. In progress A case is being worked on. In action process A case triggered an action process and is waiting for it to be resolved. Closed A case has been closed. Deleted A case has been deleted. Create Transitions # A transition represents a change between two statuses (As an example you might move a case from New status to Being worked on status).
A transition can have an optional dialog attached to it to collect information as part of the transition.
When we talk about transitions we will use source as the start status of the transition and target as the end status.
We have the following fields when creating a transition.
Field Description Transition Name The name of the Transition we are defining. From status The start Case Status for the transition. To status The end Case Status for the transition. Dialog An optional dialog attached to the transition. Related Workflow When transitioning to a Case Status of the Status Group In action process we can set a related workflow that will be used to trigger the creation of a new Action when this transition is performed. This option is currently only available for Message Workflows. Start Status Specify what status a newly created Action should have in the Related Workflow. The Related Workflow option is only used when the To status is a Case Status of Status Group In action process.
Create Dialog # A dialog represents a set of fields configurable by the end user to collect information or trigger actions on a change of status for a case (a transition). Dialog are attached to transitions.
The fields you can specify are.
Field Description Dialog name The name of the workflow dialog, support multiple languages. Description Optional description for the dialog. Fields The list of fields used in the dialog. As you can see there is a sizable selection of field types. Lets have a look at each and what they mean before constructing our custom dialog.
Field Type Triggers Description Textfield No A single row free text entry field. Textarea No A text area with more columns for free text entry. Text Editor A text area with basic formatting for free text entry. Number No Entering any numeric value. Date No Specifiying a date. Perform Task Yes A field allowing you to specify who performed the task. Action Name Yes The title field that will be used when creating a new Action entry for a transition going into an In action process group state Comment Yes Allows the user to comment on the transition between states and set who is getting notified about the comment. Acknowledgement Yes Lets the user acknowledge that specific users performed their tasks. Task Assignment Setup Yes Allows the user to create tasks of a specific type when transitioning between statues. One can also control if one wants to collect a Due date, Planned hours and Planned start date. You can add fields to the dialog, seeing the preview of the dialog on the left hand side. Once you have specified all the fields you can click the Save Changes button at the bottom right to persist the changes to the workflow.
Graph Tab # The Graph Tab shows a graphical representation of the workflow. Each box represents a Case Status in the workflow and each line between the Case Statuses represents a transition between two states. The above workflow is very simple, below is a more complex workflor example.
Use the Graph Tab to validate your workflow and ensure you did not miss any transitions. A Case Status without any transitions is a typical signal that one might have missed a transition or that the Case Status is not needed.
Processing Tab # The processing tab contains setting to set defaults for case deadlines and escalations for all form types and forms associated with this particular workflow.
Due dates # Allows the control of how due date notifications are handled. This allows one to set general due date handling settings for this workflow and thus forms using this workflow.
Forms let you override these so you can for example have a form Accident that have much shorter automatic due dates compared to the general workflow. Form settings will override the workflow.
The available fields.
Field Description Number of days before overdue The number of days since the last update happened to a case before it\u0026rsquo;s considered overdue. Reminder email frequencey The frequence of sending overdue email notifications. These are options like Off, Every day, Everyone Monday etc. Time of day to send overdue emails Specify the time of day to send the email. For example you might overdue notices to be delivered after 9 in the morning. This is not an exact time. The email some time after the specified time depending on your email system and sending time. Escalation # Allows the control of how escalations are handled. This allows one to set general escalation handling settings for this workflow and thus forms using this workflow.
Forms let you override these so you can for example have a form Accident that have much shorter automatic escalation date compared to the general workflow. Form settings will override the workflow.
The available fields.
Field Description Escalation of overdue cases enabled Enable or disable the escalation.

The first one will be an action workflow that will handle actions that result from registered messages.
Lets start by clicking on the Admin menu on the left side. This will unfold the Admin menu. Next click on the Workflows link to go to the overview of the workflows. Next click the New Workflow button to initiate a new workflow creation. New workflow dialog Lets fill in the workflow title and entity type.
In the Workflow title enter Action For the Entity type dropdown pick the Action entity type. Next lets build the workflow itself. Click on the Table tab.
New workflow table dialog There are three main sections when creating a new workflow. These are.
Statuses # Statuses represent states in a process. An example of a state might be New for a new case and \`Close for a closed state.
Click on the Create status button to open the New status dialog.
New workflow status dialog We are going to create three new statuses for our Action workflow.
Write Open in the Status name field. Next select the Open group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. Next repeat it but this time.
Write Being worked on in the Status name field. Next select the In progress group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. Finally lets create the close status.
Write Closed in the Status name field. Next select the Closed group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. So what do the list of groups mean?
Status Group Description Open A case is in a newly opened (first time it was opened state). This is basically used to signal a new case starting. Unprocessed A case has been created but not yet opened by any case handler. In progress A case is being worked on. In action process A case triggered an action process and is waiting for it to be resolved. Closed A case has been closed. Deleted A case has been deleted. You should now have a view that looks something like.
Workflow table view 3 statuses Finally click the Save button in the top right corner to save the whole workflow.
Dialogs # A dialog represents a set of fields configurable by the end user to collect information or trigger actions on a change of status for a case (a transition). Dialog are attached to transitions.
Lets create a dialog to allow us assign tasks and also comment on a case transition.
Click Create Dialog button to open the new dialog window. Workflow create new dialog Set the Dialog name to Task assignment. Next lets look at what kind of fields we can add to the dialog and what they mean.
Click on the Add field button. Workflow add field to dialog As you can see there is a sizable selection of field types. Lets have a look at each and what they mean before constructing our custom dialog.
Field Type Triggers Description Textfield No A single row free text entry field. Textarea No A text area with more columns for free text entry. Text Editor A text area with basic formatting for free text entry. Number No Entering any numeric value. Date No Specifiying a date. Perform Task Yes A field allowing you to specify who performed the task. Action Name Yes The title field that will be used when creating a new Action entry for a transition going into an In action process group state Comment Yes Allows the user to comment on the transition between states and set who is getting notified about the comment. Acknowledgement Yes Lets the user acknowledge that specific users performed their tasks. Task Assignment Setup Yes Allows the user to create tasks of a specific type when transitioning between statues. One can also control if one wants to collect a Due date, Planned hours and Planned start date. Add a field of type Task Assignment to the Dialog. Due date, Planned start date and Planned hours. Set the Case participant type dropdown to the value Case Participator. Leave the box Required unchecked.
Add a field of type Comment to the Dialog. Leave Required unchecked.

Next lets create an approval dialog.
Click Create Dialog button to open the new dialog window. Set the Dialog name to Approval. Add a field of type Acknowledgement to the Dialog. Leave the box Required unchecked. Add a field of type Comment to the Dialog. Leave Required unchecked. Click Save Changes to add the dialog to the workflow. Your workflow screen should look something like this now.
Workflow create new dialog Finally click the Save button in the top right corner to save the whole workflow.
Transitions # A transition represents a change between two statuses (As an example you might move a case from Open status to Being worked on status).
A transition can have an optional dialog attached to it to collect information as part of the transition.
When we talk about transitions we will use source as the start status of the transition and target as the end status.
The target status has a Status group that will trigger actions during the transition.
Status Group Actions Open When a case is transitioned into the Open group it will possibly trigger notifications to the picked case handler for the case. Unprocessed Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. In progress Usually does not trigger actions. In action process Will trigger the creation of an Action entry with its new workflow and potentially notifications. Closed Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. Deleted Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. Lets create a table that shows the transitions we will build.
From status To status Dialog Description Open Being worked on Task assignment Lets us move a case into the in progress group state. Being worked on Being worked on Task assignment Lets us move a case into the in progress group state. Being worked on Closed Approval Lets us move a case into the closed status. Lets click on the Create Transition button to bring up create transition dialog.
Workflow create new transition Build Open to Being worked on # Fill in the Transition name field with Start work. Select the Open status as the From status and Being worked on as the To status. Select the Task assignment dialog. Click the Save changes button. Being worked on to Being worked on # Fill in the Transition name field with Being worked on.

Being worked on to Closed # Fill in the Transition name field with Close. Select the Being worked on status as the From status and Close as the To status. Select the Approval dialog. Click the Save changes button. Finally click the Save button in the top right corner to save the whole workflow.
You should now have a workflow that looks like the following.
Complete workflow table Finish Action workflow # Finally click on the General tab and set the Start case status pulldown to Open and Close case status to Close. These options signal the start and end points of the workflow.
Complete workflow Finally click the Save button to save the whole workflow.
