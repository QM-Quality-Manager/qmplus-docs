Questionnaires List # Questionnaires are used to create long questionnairs and check lists that can span either a single page or multiple pages.
You can filter between Active, Deactive or All status, search by title and if the questionnaire is published or not.
Create Questionnaire # General Tab # Creating a questionnaire requires the following field.
Field Description Title Title of the questionnire, support multiple languages. Description Optional description for the questionnaire. Questionnaire display type How to render the questionnaire (Single Page or Multiple Pages). Visiblity Visiblity of the questionnaire. Department On what department the questionnaire is located. Reference One or more document references attached to the questionnaire. Tags Add tags to questionnaire to identify the questionnaire. As you can see from the image we can preview the current questionnaire.
Until you click the Publish button all changes to the questionnaire are private. Once the Publish button is clicked it will be visible to add to activities.
References can be added to documents stored in Q to add context to a Questionnaire or relevant documents.
Questionnaire Layout # The Questionnaire Builder has some core concepts to wrap ones head around. A questionnaire is a collection of of one or more pages, where each page has one or more columns of components. The preview button lets you test the questionniare during development. Clicking the save button will save a new version of the Questionnaire and once ready you can click Publish to release the new Questionnaire to be used.
All Questionnaire entries are tied to a specific Questionnaire Version meaning old data is preserved correctly against the a previous version of a Questionnaire.
The available components are as follows.
Component Description Text A text description field to enter text information on the questionnaire. Image Allows adding an image to the questionnaire, can be used to show information. Single choice Create a question with answers, allowing the end user to choose one. Multi choice Create a question with answers, allowing the end user to choose multiple ones. Ranking Create a question with answers, allowing the end user to drag and drop them in the order of ranking. Integer A field that lets you specify a whole number. Decimal A field that lets you specify a decimal number. Currency A field that lets you specify a currency number. Number in range A field that lets you specify a start and end value and the step size for the slider. One-line text field A single line text field. Multiline text field A multiple line text field. Risk A Risk category group. Components can be resized horizontally and moved around. Depending on the number of columns you define you can organize the components side by side.
Page Settings # The page settings allow you change the page title as well as description. You can also add references to documents from Q as well as tags.
Text # A text field that lets you specify some read-only text for the questionnaire. Can be used for instructions related to a field or additional information.
Image # Add a read-only image to the questionnaire to show instructions or additional information related to a question.

Create new Risk Model # General Pages # To create a new Risk Model we need to specify a name for the risk model (it supports multiple languages). One can also add a optional description for the model.
Building the Risk Model # A risk model is composed of dimensions that contain scales with values used to calculate a final score.
For example you might have a Likelyhood scale as well as a Impact scale, where each scale in each dimension has an associated value.
When entering a risk value the user will choose one value from each dimension and platform will then calculate a corresponding risk value dependent on the formula associated with the risk model.
As you add scales to the dimensions you can see the preview of the risk model on the left. To define colors based on the calculated values in the risk matrix we can provide ranges with associated colors by adding and modifying the color range levels at the bottom right corner.
This model shows a complete basic risk model with associated dimensions, scales and color ranges.
When adding or editing a new scale to a dimension we can provide a name, description and value for the scale.

Token Type Description API Tokens Tokens used to integrate with Q using external applications or code. Mobile users logged in An overview of Mobile Application tokens, allowing us to view who uses the Mobile App and also revoke access. Tokens are tied to a User and User Type. This allows you to control access more fine-grained by using permissions to restrict acces. You might for example make a token that only allows access to Department A and has no access to operate on users.
Deleting Tokens # Deleting multiple mobile user tokens, revoking access Tokens can also be deleted to revoke access both for the API Token and Mobile Users logged in. Either one by one or by using the checkbox on the left side to select multiple entries to delete at the same time.

User Type The user type the token is associated with. Last active Last time the user was active. Expiry date The current expiry date for the token. API Token view The API Token view is a litte bit different because our expectation is that you will need access to the actual token.
Field Description Token name The name entered when creating the token. API Token The token string used to call the REST API. Tenant Id Application customer Id. Description of use Basic text that explains how to use the token to call the REST API endpoints. Expiry date The entered expiry date for this API token.

Choose color of avatar or upload/webcam Below we can see the dialog where we can upload an image or use the webcam (requires the user to give permissions to access the camera).
Upload image or take webcam snap Once you have uploaded an image or taking a photo with the webcam you can adjust the capture area and set the result.
Adjust avatar image Department and User Types # Department and user type view Every user needs at least one department and user type combination added to it. A user can have multiple combinations of department and user type but no duplicated roles.
For example an administrator might have two combinations.
For the top department they might be an administrator. At the same time they are an employee on another department.
Select department Select user type The effect of having multiple combinations of department and user type will lead to a dialog when logging in allowing you to pick which combination you are going to log in as.
Change department and usertype You also get access to changing your department/user type combination in a pull down on the top right. Click on one of the combination will change your view of the application allowing you to switch from for example an employee view of the organization to an administrator view.
Custom Permissions/Roles # Custom permissions/Roles Besides setting combinations of department and usertype you can also add user specific permissions/roles. This lets you control the permissions of a specific user in a fine grained manner, using the user type as a starting point.
Notifications # Notification Tab In the Notifications tab you can set the notification settings for the user.
User Substitutions # List View # Substitutes list The User Substitutions tab allows us to create substitutions for employees allwing us to delegate responsibility to other users for a specific amount of time.
Substitutions can be used to delegate responsibilities in cases such as vacation, medical leave or parental leave.
As can se from the listing we get a complete list of the substitutions.
This lets us know the person being subsituted, who is substituting the person, what combination of department and user type the subsitution applies to and finally the duration of the subsitution.
If we decide to delete a substitution entry, we have two scenarios.
If the period is not active, the whole substituion is deleted If we are already in the substitution period, it\u0026rsquo;s cut short (end date is modified to the current date and time). Create Substitute # New workflow dialog We can create subsititutions of a user by another easily. First select the user to be substituted. This will then show you their list of department and user type. Pick which combination you wish to subsitute. Then select the substituting user and set the period the substitution is in effect. Finally click Save to create the subsitution rule.
A substituting user will now see the additional department and user type combination show up in the list of available options when logging in.
Data routed to the original user will now also be routed to the subtitute user instead of the original user.

There are two types of permissions in the system.
Type Description System System permissions are permissions that control the access to sections or actions in the application itself and provided from the application. These might be permissions that let you administer users for example or view reports. These cannot be customized by the user and as new functionality is added might expand. Custom Custom permissions are permissions that the user can create that can be used to tag content such as documents, or limit access to things like departments. For example you might have a confidential document that you only want two people to access to. In this case you could make a confidential document custom permission and assign it to the document as well as the two users that you want to have access. The lack of the permission will block the user from being able to access the document. See all available System Permissions

Workflows List # The Workflows list overview lets you see all workflows defined in the system. Workflows are global and shared by all departments in the organization.
Workflows can be activated and deactivated as needed. This does not affect existing form types that use the workflow but makes it impossible to create new form types of that particular workflow.
Create Workflow # There are four tabs to consider when creating a new workflow.
Tab Description General Entering general details for workflow. Table Edit the statuses, transitions and dialogs that make up the workflow. Graph A graphical representation of the workflow. Processing Default processing settings for the workflow such as automatic deadlines etc. General Tab # The general page allows us to fill out the following fields.
Field Description Title Specify the title of the workflow, support multiple languages if your account is configured for it. Entity Type Select the entity type of the workflow, once set it cannot be changed. This can be Message, Action, Document, Hearing or Audit Disable transitions checking This lets you override any transitions, making it possible to freely drag tickts between any transitions on the case board. Great when you want to implement Kanban processes or other non-gated processes Start case status Set the default case start status. This is the case status that will be assigned to a new case for this workflow if no other rules override it. Close case status Set the default close case status used for default close operations. Early caseprocess Specify that this workflow supports the use of Early caseprocess rules set up to assign new cases to case handlers based on specified rules. Associated hearing workflow Document only. Allows you to specify an associated hearings workflow to this document workflow that will handle any hearings initiated for a document attached to this workflow. Associated audit workflow Document only. Allows you to specify an associated audit workflow to this document workflow to handle all hearings. Table Tab # The Table Tab allows us to build and modifty the workflow entities. There are three types of available entities.
Entity Description Case Status Case statuses are defined states a case can be in. For example you might have a case status called New for a newly registered form entry and Closed for the final possible state for a case. Transitions Transitions control the flow of case between case statuses. It makes it possible to enforce a workflow by specifying the legal transitions between statuses. For example you might make it possible to only move a case from New to Under work by adding a single transition between those statuses. Dialogs Dialogs are collections of fields that can bet attached to a transition. For example you might decide that you want the user to add a comment when moving a case from the case status New to Under work and a dialog attached to this transition between those fields will lead the dialog to pop up for the user to fill out when moving between the statuses. Create Status # To create a new Case status you need to enter the following fields.
Field Description Name The name of the case status, support multiple languages. Status Group The Status Group for this Case Status, see the table below for explenations. Description Optional description for the case status. The possible Status Groups are detailed below.
Status Group Description Open A case is in a newly opened (first time it was opened state). This is basically used to signal a new case starting. Unprocessed A case has been created but not yet opened by any case handler. In progress A case is being worked on. In action process A case triggered an action process and is waiting for it to be resolved. Closed A case has been closed. Deleted A case has been deleted. Create Transitions # A transition represents a change between two statuses (As an example you might move a case from New status to Being worked on status).
A transition can have an optional dialog attached to it to collect information as part of the transition.
When we talk about transitions we will use source as the start status of the transition and target as the end status.
We have the following fields when creating a transition.
Field Description Transition Name The name of the Transition we are defining. From status The start Case Status for the transition. To status The end Case Status for the transition. Dialog An optional dialog attached to the transition. Related Workflow When transitioning to a Case Status of the Status Group In action process we can set a related workflow that will be used to trigger the creation of a new Action when this transition is performed. This option is currently only available for Message Workflows. Start Status Specify what status a newly created Action should have in the Related Workflow. The Related Workflow option is only used when the To status is a Case Status of Status Group In action process.
Create Dialog # A dialog represents a set of fields configurable by the end user to collect information or trigger actions on a change of status for a case (a transition). Dialog are attached to transitions.
The fields you can specify are.
Field Description Dialog name The name of the workflow dialog, support multiple languages. Description Optional description for the dialog. Fields The list of fields used in the dialog. As you can see there is a sizable selection of field types. Lets have a look at each and what they mean before constructing our custom dialog.
Field Type Triggers Description Textfield No A single row free text entry field. Textarea No A text area with more columns for free text entry. Text Editor A text area with basic formatting for free text entry. Number No Entering any numeric value. Date No Specifiying a date. Perform Task Yes A field allowing you to specify who performed the task. Action Name Yes The title field that will be used when creating a new Action entry for a transition going into an In action process group state Comment Yes Allows the user to comment on the transition between states and set who is getting notified about the comment. Acknowledgement Yes Lets the user acknowledge that specific users performed their tasks. Task Assignment Setup Yes Allows the user to create tasks of a specific type when transitioning between statues. One can also control if one wants to collect a Due date, Planned hours and Planned start date. You can add fields to the dialog, seeing the preview of the dialog on the left hand side. Once you have specified all the fields you can click the Save Changes button at the bottom right to persist the changes to the workflow.
Graph Tab # The Graph Tab shows a graphical representation of the workflow. Each box represents a Case Status in the workflow and each line between the Case Statuses represents a transition between two states. The above workflow is very simple, below is a more complex workflor example.
Use the Graph Tab to validate your workflow and ensure you did not miss any transitions. A Case Status without any transitions is a typical signal that one might have missed a transition or that the Case Status is not needed.
Processing Tab # The processing tab contains setting to set defaults for case deadlines and escalations for all form types and forms associated with this particular workflow.
Due dates # Allows the control of how due date notifications are handled. This allows one to set general due date handling settings for this workflow and thus forms using this workflow.
Forms let you override these so you can for example have a form Accident that have much shorter automatic due dates compared to the general workflow. Form settings will override the workflow.
The available fields.
Field Description Number of days before overdue The number of days since the last update happened to a case before it\u0026rsquo;s considered overdue. Reminder email frequencey The frequence of sending overdue email notifications. These are options like Off, Every day, Everyone Monday etc. Time of day to send overdue emails Specify the time of day to send the email. For example you might overdue notices to be delivered after 9 in the morning. This is not an exact time. The email some time after the specified time depending on your email system and sending time. Escalation # Allows the control of how escalations are handled. This allows one to set general escalation handling settings for this workflow and thus forms using this workflow.
Forms let you override these so you can for example have a form Accident that have much shorter automatic escalation date compared to the general workflow. Form settings will override the workflow.
The available fields.
Field Description Escalation of overdue cases enabled Enable or disable the escalation. Escalate after N hours overdue The number of hours since the last case update happened before it\u0026rsquo;s considered for escalation. Escalation strategy The strategy to pick to whom to escalate the case. See available strategies below. Time of day to escalate mesages What time of the day to escalate messages. Number of hours for next due date after escalation The next due date after escalating the case to a new case handler. The available strategies.
Strategy Description Direct supervisor The case will be sent to the persons closest direct supervisor with permission to process cases.

Clicking on the Cases board gives access to Cases board.
Handling the Case board # case_board_1.png The case board is the easiest and powerful way of managing cases for workflows. It lets you move cases between states easily, filter the board by different criteria and access the case information.
Option Description Select the workflow Select between the workflows you have access to, allowing you to switch between case boards. Case status The workflow case statuses, are laid out as columns where cases in that status group is laid out. The exception is the Close case status columns where they are grouped by week to avoid information overload. Collapse/Expand the column User can collapse/expand the columns to lessen the information density of the screen. Case Each box represents a current case in the system. The user can click on the case to bring up the quick view of the case details. The \u0026hellip; menu on the case box allows access to a menu over statuses the case is allowed to move to. Search The top right search box lets you filter the cases visible on the board by searching the title and description of the cases avaialble. Case Status Transition # case_board_6.png To move cases you can grab a case and drag it to a new status.
case_board_3.png If the transition from the existing case status to the new case status requires filling in a dialog it will pop up and has to be completed before the case is moved to the new state.
case_board_5.png You can also move a case by clicking the hamburger menu on the top right corner of each case and then selecting one of the allowed state transitions.
View Case Information # case_board_4.png When clicking on a case in the case board we get the compact case view. You can click on the arrow icon in the top right corner of the compact case view to open the full case view. There are a fair bit of options in the compact case view.

Pre-defined filter Description Handled by me All cases where the current logged in user is the case handler. Approved by me All cases where the current logged in user is the approver. Participated in by me All cases where the current logged in user is a case participant. No case handler All cases that have no current case handler. No case approvers All cases that have no current case approver. No tasks All cases that have no associated tasks with them. Overdue All overdue cases. Updated today All cases updated today. Updated in last week All cases updated during the last week. Created today All cases created today. Created in last week All cases created during the last week. There are several additional filters that can be used that vary depending on the type of workflow (if it\u0026rsquo;s a message, action, document, hearing or audit workflow).
Filter Entity Types Description Case approvers All Add case approver users to filter by. Will show cases that have at least one of the users added as an approver. Case handler All Add case chandler users to filter by. Will show cases that have at least one of the users added as a case handler.

The first one will be an action workflow that will handle actions that result from registered messages.
Lets start by clicking on the Admin menu on the left side. This will unfold the Admin menu. Next click on the Workflows link to go to the overview of the workflows. Next click the New Workflow button to initiate a new workflow creation. New workflow dialog Lets fill in the workflow title and entity type.
In the Workflow title enter Action For the Entity type dropdown pick the Action entity type. Next lets build the workflow itself. Click on the Table tab.
New workflow table dialog There are three main sections when creating a new workflow. These are.
Statuses # Statuses represent states in a process. An example of a state might be New for a new case and \`Close for a closed state.
Click on the Create status button to open the New status dialog.
New workflow status dialog We are going to create three new statuses for our Action workflow.
Write Open in the Status name field. Next select the Open group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. Next repeat it but this time.
Write Being worked on in the Status name field. Next select the In progress group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. Finally lets create the close status.
Write Closed in the Status name field. Next select the Closed group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. So what do the list of groups mean?
Status Group Description Open A case is in a newly opened (first time it was opened state). This is basically used to signal a new case starting. Unprocessed A case has been created but not yet opened by any case handler. In progress A case is being worked on. In action process A case triggered an action process and is waiting for it to be resolved. Closed A case has been closed. Deleted A case has been deleted. You should now have a view that looks something like.

Dialogs # A dialog represents a set of fields configurable by the end user to collect information or trigger actions on a change of status for a case (a transition). Dialog are attached to transitions.
Lets create a dialog to allow us assign tasks and also comment on a case transition.
Click Create Dialog button to open the new dialog window. Workflow create new dialog Set the Dialog name to Task assignment. Next lets look at what kind of fields we can add to the dialog and what they mean.
Click on the Add field button. Workflow add field to dialog As you can see there is a sizable selection of field types. Lets have a look at each and what they mean before constructing our custom dialog.
Field Type Triggers Description Textfield No A single row free text entry field. Textarea No A text area with more columns for free text entry. Text Editor A text area with basic formatting for free text entry. Number No Entering any numeric value. Date No Specifiying a date. Perform Task Yes A field allowing you to specify who performed the task. Action Name Yes The title field that will be used when creating a new Action entry for a transition going into an In action process group state Comment Yes Allows the user to comment on the transition between states and set who is getting notified about the comment. Acknowledgement Yes Lets the user acknowledge that specific users performed their tasks. Task Assignment Setup Yes Allows the user to create tasks of a specific type when transitioning between statues. One can also control if one wants to collect a Due date, Planned hours and Planned start date. Add a field of type Task Assignment to the Dialog. Due date, Planned start date and Planned hours. Set the Case participant type dropdown to the value Case Participator. Leave the box Required unchecked.

Workflow create new dialog Finally click the Save button in the top right corner to save the whole workflow.
Transitions # A transition represents a change between two statuses (As an example you might move a case from Open status to Being worked on status).
A transition can have an optional dialog attached to it to collect information as part of the transition.
When we talk about transitions we will use source as the start status of the transition and target as the end status.
The target status has a Status group that will trigger actions during the transition.
Status Group Actions Open When a case is transitioned into the Open group it will possibly trigger notifications to the picked case handler for the case. Unprocessed Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. In progress Usually does not trigger actions. In action process Will trigger the creation of an Action entry with its new workflow and potentially notifications. Closed Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. Deleted Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. Lets create a table that shows the transitions we will build.
From status To status Dialog Description Open Being worked on Task assignment Lets us move a case into the in progress group state. Being worked on Being worked on Task assignment Lets us move a case into the in progress group state. Being worked on Closed Approval Lets us move a case into the closed status. Lets click on the Create Transition button to bring up create transition dialog.
Workflow create new transition Build Open to Being worked on # Fill in the Transition name field with Start work. Select the Open status as the From status and Being worked on as the To status.
