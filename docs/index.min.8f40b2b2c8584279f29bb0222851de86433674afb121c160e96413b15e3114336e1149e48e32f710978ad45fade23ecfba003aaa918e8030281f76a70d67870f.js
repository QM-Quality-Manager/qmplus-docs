Clicking on the Administrator/Workflows gives access to the list of workflows.
Workflows List # The Workflows list overview lets you see all workflows defined in the system. Workflows are global and shared by all departments in the organization.
Workflows can be activated and deactivated as needed. This does not affect existing form types that use the workflow but makes it impossible to create new form types of that particular workflow.
Create Workflow # There are four tabs to consider when creating a new workflow.
Tab Description General Entering general details for workflow. Table Edit the statuses, transitions and dialogs that make up the workflow. Graph A graphical representation of the workflow. Processing Default processing settings for the workflow such as automatic deadlines etc. General Tab # The general page allows us to fill out the following fields.
Field Description Title Specify the title of the workflow, support multiple languages if your account is configured for it. Entity Type Select the entity type of the workflow, once set it cannot be changed. This can be Message, Action, Document, Hearing or Audit Disable transitions checking This lets you override any transitions, making it possible to freely drag tickts between any transitions on the case board. Great when you want to implement Kanban processes or other non-gated processes Start case status Set the default case start status. This is the case status that will be assigned to a new case for this workflow if no other rules override it. Close case status Set the default close case status used for default close operations. Early caseprocess Specify that this workflow supports the use of Early caseprocess rules set up to assign new cases to case handlers based on specified rules. Associated hearing workflow Document only. Allows you to specify an associated hearings workflow to this document workflow that will handle any hearings initiated for a document attached to this workflow. Associated audit workflow Document only. Allows you to specify an associated audit workflow to this document workflow to handle all hearings. Table Tab # The Table Tab allows us to build and modifty the workflow entities. There are three types of available entities.
Entity Description Case Status Case statuses are defined states a case can be in. For example you might have a case status called New for a newly registered form entry and Closed for the final possible state for a case. Transitions Transitions control the flow of case between case statuses. It makes it possible to enforce a workflow by specifying the legal transitions between statuses. For example you might make it possible to only move a case from New to Under work by adding a single transition between those statuses. Dialogs Dialogs are collections of fields that can bet attached to a transition. For example you might decide that you want the user to add a comment when moving a case from the case status New to Under work and a dialog attached to this transition between those fields will lead the dialog to pop up for the user to fill out when moving between the statuses. Create Status # To create a new Case status you need to enter the following fields.
Field Description Name The name of the case status, support multiple languages. Status Group The Status Group for this Case Status, see the table below for explenations. Description Optional description for the case status. The possible Status Groups are detailed below.
Status Group Description Open A case is in a newly opened (first time it was opened state). This is basically used to signal a new case starting. Unprocessed A case has been created but not yet opened by any case handler. In progress A case is being worked on. In action process A case triggered an action process and is waiting for it to be resolved. Closed A case has been closed. Deleted A case has been deleted. Create Transitions # A transition represents a change between two statuses (As an example you might move a case from New status to Being worked on status).
A transition can have an optional dialog attached to it to collect information as part of the transition.
When we talk about transitions we will use source as the start status of the transition and target as the end status.
We have the following fields when creating a transition.
Field Description Transition Name The name of the Transition we are defining. From status The start Case Status for the transition. To status The end Case Status for the transition. Dialog An optional dialog attached to the transition. Related Workflow When transitioning to a Case Status of the Status Group In action process we can set a related workflow that will be used to trigger the creation of a new Action when this transition is performed. This option is currently only available for Message Workflows. Start Status Specify what status a newly created Action should have in the Related Workflow. The Related Workflow option is only used when the To status is a Case Status of Status Group In action process.
Create Dialog # A dialog represents a set of fields configurable by the end user to collect information or trigger actions on a change of status for a case (a transition). Dialog are attached to transitions.
The fields you can specify are.
Field Description Dialog name The name of the workflow dialog, support multiple languages. Description Optional description for the dialog. Fields The list of fields used in the dialog. As you can see there is a sizable selection of field types. Lets have a look at each and what they mean before constructing our custom dialog.
Field Type Triggers Description Textfield No A single row free text entry field. Textarea No A text area with more columns for free text entry. Text Editor A text area with basic formatting for free text entry. Number No Entering any numeric value. Date No Specifiying a date. Perform Task Yes A field allowing you to specify who performed the task. Action Name Yes The title field that will be used when creating a new Action entry for a transition going into an In action process group state Comment Yes Allows the user to comment on the transition between states and set who is getting notified about the comment. Acknowledgement Yes Lets the user acknowledge that specific users performed their tasks. Task Assignment Setup Yes Allows the user to create tasks of a specific type when transitioning between statues. One can also control if one wants to collect a Due date, Planned hours and Planned start date. You can add fields to the dialog, seeing the preview of the dialog on the left hand side. Once you have specified all the fields you can click the Save Changes button at the bottom right to persist the changes to the workflow.
Graph Tab # The Graph Tab shows a graphical representation of the workflow. Each box represents a Case Status in the workflow and each line between the Case Statuses represents a transition between two states. The above workflow is very simple, below is a more complex workflor example.
Use the Graph Tab to validate your workflow and ensure you did not miss any transitions. A Case Status without any transitions is a typical signal that one might have missed a transition or that the Case Status is not needed.
Processing Tab # The processing tab contains setting to set defaults for case deadlines and escalations for all form types and forms associated with this particular workflow.
Due dates # Allows the control of how due date notifications are handled. This allows one to set general due date handling settings for this workflow and thus forms using this workflow.
Forms let you override these so you can for example have a form Accident that have much shorter automatic due dates compared to the general workflow. Form settings will override the workflow.
The available fields.
Field Description Number of days before overdue The number of days since the last update happened to a case before it\u0026rsquo;s considered overdue. Reminder email frequencey The frequence of sending overdue email notifications. These are options like Off, Every day, Everyone Monday etc. Time of day to send overdue emails Specify the time of day to send the email. For example you might overdue notices to be delivered after 9 in the morning. This is not an exact time. The email some time after the specified time depending on your email system and sending time. Escalation # Allows the control of how escalations are handled. This allows one to set general escalation handling settings for this workflow and thus forms using this workflow.
Forms let you override these so you can for example have a form Accident that have much shorter automatic escalation date compared to the general workflow. Form settings will override the workflow.
The available fields.
Field Description Escalation of overdue cases enabled Enable or disable the escalation. Escalate after N hours overdue The number of hours since the last case update happened before it\u0026rsquo;s considered for escalation. Escalation strategy The strategy to pick to whom to escalate the case. See available strategies below. Time of day to escalate mesages What time of the day to escalate messages. Number of hours for next due date after escalation The next due date after escalating the case to a new case handler. The available strategies.
Strategy Description Direct supervisor The case will be sent to the persons closest direct supervisor with permission to process cases. If there are more than one potential supervisor it will pick on of them on random. `}),e.add({id:16,href:"/docs/references/permissions/",title:"Application Permissions",description:"In this section we provide an overview of the permissions (roles) provided on the platform.",content:`Administrator menu access permissions # Role Id Description MENU_ADMIN 14 The user had access to the Administrator Menu MENU_ADMIN_USERS 1 The user had access to the Administrator User MENU_ADMIN_USER_TYPES 3 The user has access to the Administrator Usertypes MENU_ADMIN_DEPARTMENTS 2 The user has access to the Administrator Departments MENU_ADMIN_CATEGORIES 4 The user has access to the Administrator Categories MENU_ADMIN_FORMS 5 The user has access to the Administrator Forms MENU_ADMIN_RULES 6 The user has access to the Administrator Rules MENU_ADMIN_DOCUMENTS 7 The user has access to the Administrator Documents MENU_ADMIN_ROLES 8 The user has access to the Administrator Roles MENU_ADMIN_WORKFLOW 86 The user has access to the Administrator Workflows MENU_ADMIN_LISTS 90 The user has access to the Administrator Lists MENU_ADMIN_RISK_MODEL 170 The user has access to the Administrator Risk Models MENU_ADMIN_USER_ACCESS 171 The user has access to the Administrator API Tokens MENU_ADMIN_ACTIVITIES 66 The user has access to the Administrator Activities MENU_ADMIN_REPORTS 91 The user has access to the Administrator Reports Access system administrator permissions # Role Id Description ACCESS_SYSTEM_ADMINISTRATOR 9 The user can create/update/delete user types as well as assign usertypes and roles to users.

Lets start by clicking on the Admin menu on the left side. This will unfold the Admin menu. Next click on the Workflows link to go to the overview of the workflows. Next click the New Workflow button to initiate a new workflow creation. New workflow dialog Lets fill in the workflow title and entity type.
In the Workflow title enter Action For the Entity type dropdown pick the Action entity type. Next lets build the workflow itself. Click on the Table tab.
New workflow table dialog There are three main sections when creating a new workflow. These are.
Statuses # Statuses represent states in a process. An example of a state might be New for a new case and \`Close for a closed state.
Click on the Create status button to open the New status dialog.
New workflow status dialog We are going to create three new statuses for our Action workflow.
Write Open in the Status name field. Next select the Open group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. Next repeat it but this time.

Transitions # A transition represents a change between two statuses (As an example you might move a case from Open status to Being worked on status).
A transition can have an optional dialog attached to it to collect information as part of the transition.
When we talk about transitions we will use source as the start status of the transition and target as the end status.
The target status has a Status group that will trigger actions during the transition.
Status Group Actions Open When a case is transitioned into the Open group it will possibly trigger notifications to the picked case handler for the case. Unprocessed Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. In progress Usually does not trigger actions. In action process Will trigger the creation of an Action entry with its new workflow and potentially notifications. Closed Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. Deleted Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. Lets create a table that shows the transitions we will build.
From status To status Dialog Description Open Being worked on Task assignment Lets us move a case into the in progress group state. Being worked on Being worked on Task assignment Lets us move a case into the in progress group state. Being worked on Closed Approval Lets us move a case into the closed status.
