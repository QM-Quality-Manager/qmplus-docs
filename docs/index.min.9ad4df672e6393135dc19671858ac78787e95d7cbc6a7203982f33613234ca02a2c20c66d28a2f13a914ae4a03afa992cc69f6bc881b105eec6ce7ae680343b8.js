The first one will be an action workflow that will handle actions that result from registered messages.
Lets start by clicking on the Admin menu on the left side. This will unfold the Admin menu. Next click on the Workflows link to go to the overview of the workflows. Next click the New Workflow button to initiate a new workflow creation. New workflow dialog Lets fill in the workflow title and entity type.
In the Workflow title enter Action For the Entity type dropdown pick the Action entity type. Next lets build the workflow itself. Click on the Table tab.
New workflow table dialog There are three main sections when creating a new workflow. These are.
Statuses # Statuses represent states in a process. An example of a state might be New for a new case and \`Close for a closed state.
Click on the Create status button to open the New status dialog.
New workflow status dialog We are going to create three new statuses for our Action workflow.
Write Open in the Status name field. Next select the Open group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. Next repeat it but this time.
Write Being worked on in the Status name field. Next select the In progress group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. Finally lets create the close status.
Write Closed in the Status name field. Next select the Closed group. Click on the Save Changes button to save the new status. So what do the list of groups mean?
Status Group Description Open A case is in a newly opened (first time it was opened state). This is basically used to signal a new case starting. Unprocessed A case has been created but not yet opened by any case handler. In progress A case is being worked on. In action process A case triggered an action process and is waiting for it to be resolved. Closed A case has been closed. Deleted A case has been deleted. You should now have a view that looks something like.
Workflow table view 3 statuses Finally click the Save button in the top right corner to save the whole workflow.
Dialogs # A dialog represents a set of fields configurable by the end user to collect information or trigger actions on a change of status for a case (a transition). Dialog are attached to transitions.
Lets create a dialog to allow us assign tasks and also comment on a case transition.
Click Create Dialog button to open the new dialog window. Workflow create new dialog Set the Dialog name to Task assignment. Next lets look at what kind of fields we can add to the dialog and what they mean.
Click on the Add field button. Workflow add field to dialog As you can see there is a sizable selection of field types. Lets have a look at each and what they mean before constructing our custom dialog.
Field Type Triggers Description Textfield No A single row free text entry field. Textarea No A text area with more columns for free text entry. Text Editor A text area with basic formatting for free text entry. Number No Entering any numeric value. Date No Specifiying a date. Perform Task Yes A field allowing you to specify who performed the task. Action Name Yes The title field that will be used when creating a new Action entry for a transition going into an In action process group state Comment Yes Allows the user to comment on the transition between states and set who is getting notified about the comment. Acknowledgement Yes Lets the user acknowledge that specific users performed their tasks. Task Assignment Setup Yes Allows the user to create tasks of a specific type when transitioning between statues. One can also control if one wants to collect a Due date, Planned hours and Planned start date. Add a field of type Task Assignment to the Dialog. Due date, Planned start date and Planned hours. Set the Case participant type dropdown to the value Case Participator. Leave the box Required unchecked.
Add a field of type Comment to the Dialog. Leave Required unchecked.
Click Save Changes to add the dialog to the workflow.
Next lets create an approval dialog.
Click Create Dialog button to open the new dialog window. Set the Dialog name to Approval. Add a field of type Acknowledgement to the Dialog. Leave the box Required unchecked. Add a field of type Comment to the Dialog. Leave Required unchecked. Click Save Changes to add the dialog to the workflow. Your workflow screen should look something like this now.
Workflow create new dialog Finally click the Save button in the top right corner to save the whole workflow.
Transitions # A transition represents a change between two statuses (As an example you might move a case from Open status to Being worked on status).
A transition can have an optional dialog attached to it to collect information as part of the transition.
When we talk about transitions we will use source as the start status of the transition and target as the end status.
The target status has a Status group that will trigger actions during the transition.
Status Group Actions Open When a case is transitioned into the Open group it will possibly trigger notifications to the picked case handler for the case. Unprocessed Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. In progress Usually does not trigger actions. In action process Will trigger the creation of an Action entry with its new workflow and potentially notifications. Closed Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. Deleted Might trigger notifications to the target case handler. Lets create a table that shows the transitions we will build.
From status To status Dialog Description Open Being worked on Task assignment Lets us move a case into the in progress group state. Being worked on Being worked on Task assignment Lets us move a case into the in progress group state. Being worked on Closed Approval Lets us move a case into the closed status. Lets click on the Create Transition button to bring up create transition dialog.
Workflow create new transition Build Open to Being worked on # Fill in the Transition name field with Start work. Select the Open status as the From status and Being worked on as the To status. Select the Task assignment dialog. Click the Save changes button. Being worked on to Being worked on # Fill in the Transition name field with Being worked on. Select the Being worked on status as the From status and Being worked on as the To status. Select the Task assignment dialog. Click the Save changes button. Being worked on to Closed # Fill in the Transition name field with Close. Select the Being worked on status as the From status and Close as the To status. Select the Approval dialog. Click the Save changes button. Finally click the Save button in the top right corner to save the whole workflow.
You should now have a workflow that looks like the following.
Complete workflow table Finish Action workflow # Finally click on the General tab and set the Start case status pulldown to Open and Close case status to Close. These options signal the start and end points of the workflow.
Complete workflow Finally click the Save button to save the whole workflow.
